<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">ANDERHALF KOPJE KOFFIE</span></h5>
<center><p><i>Please refer to: <a href="anderhalfkopjekoffie.nl">anderhalfkopjekoffie.nl</a></i></p></center>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">BETTER STORY THAN BLADE RUNNER</span></h5>
<p>On a freezing cold day in November of 2017, some Link members (Michelle, Bart, Jeroen, Justin, Guus and Joost) went to the movie Blade Runner 2049. Beautifully filmed, great audio (although Zaal 7 fucked it up), kinda enjoyable, yes. However, the movie’s plot is.. just not present. Everything in that movie could also just.. not have happened.
<br>
Even this text is a better story than the movie.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">CHINESE POISON</span></h5>
<p>In the summer of 2017, Geerlof went on a trip to China and he brought back some bottles of the most discusting and most smelly booze ever.
<br>
Also often referred to as ‘Chinese Dogpiss’.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">DAAR KUN JE EEN PAARD TEGENAAN ZETTEN</span></h5>
<p>A saying by Bart.
<br>It’s pronounced like this: “Doar kende un pert tigenoan zette”.
<br>Meaning: the subject of the matter is solid enough to put a horse against it.
<br>You can use this saying when, for example, you just got a new nice and sturdy wall in your living room.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">FRANSKE KLOKKEN</span></h5>
<p>Franske is a ‘friettent’ near Tilburg University. Famous Link member Yosje also works there.
<br>Now there are a lot of clocks on the wall there, all supposed to tell the time in different places on Earth. Great idea, fun! However, there was not a single time that even one of the clocks told the correct time in any city, ever.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">give destroy</span></h5>
<p>When Joost played a game of HoTS, some Russian guy told the team to ‘give destroy’. Within Link, this term gets almost exclusively used in erotic ways.
<br>This meme is kind of dead, but Yosje & Joost still regularly use it.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">GUUS WHY</span></h5>
<p>At Dutch Comic Con Winter 2017, Joost and Guus cosplayed as Mermaidman & Barnacle boy. Many, many pictures we’re made - one of which got cropped so that only Guus’ head remained, with eyes just shouting “I REGRET THIS”. Then the words ‘WHY’ were added to this picture.
<br><a href="http://anderhalfkopjekoffie.nl/why.jpg">It's great</a>.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">I AN DEAN IS NOT BIT GUPRUGE</span></h5>
<p>When Geerlof moved to another place in Tilburg, at his housewarming, he started playing drinking games and drank too much whiskey. <a href="http://anderhalfkopjekoffie.nl/deanapp.jpg">In the party chat</a> he started writing incomprehensible sentences such as the famous “I an dean is not bit gupruge”. The original message was reverse engineered to what Geerlof originally meant to say: “I am done is not a big suprise”.
<br>This meme is often used when someone is really drunk. The format in which it is shared, is almost always a the ‘Futurama Fry / Not Sure If’ image together with the quote. You can find it <a href="http://anderhalfkopjekoffie.nl/dean">here</a>.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">JOOST GIT COMMIT</span></h5>
<p>Due to it being late, and the bad weather, Joost was doubting whether or not to travel to Tilburg for his first ever Link meetup at Café Hoegaarden. Members that were there: Justin, Bart, Guus, and Sam.
<br>After a lot of convincing and peer pressure, he showed up at around 23 o’clock - after a train ride of +1 hour which normally only takes around 20 minutes. When he was there he drank 1 beer, burned his mouth on a bitterbal, and (this is the best part) Bart told the poor boy the anderhalfkopjekoffie story.
<br>He left only 15 minutes later to catch the last train back to Den Bosch. But boy did he <i>git fucking commit</i>.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">JORI WOMAN</span></h5>
<p>The real gender of Jori is still a mystery..
<br>This meme did especially well when (at the time) new member Bianca for the first few days after joining, really did believe that Jori was a woman and was lesbian.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">JUSTIN KATARINA</span></h5>
<p><a href="http://anderhalfkopjekoffie.nl/myeyeshurt.jpg">Just look at this picture</a>.
<br>This meme was summed up by Ruben beautifully: “halloween party, drinking games, justins birthday, bosche bollen liquor - roos - justin outfit swap”</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">j&amp;cfbofical</span></h5>
<p>This meme started in a Link chat, sometime, somewhere, probably by Bart - as a petition to make the relationship between Jori & Celeste ‘Facebook Official’.
<br>However, this meme really started to get attention after a party by Yosje and Joost in Den Bosch, where j&cfbofical was repeatedly mentioned; both verbally as in Quiplash and <a href="http://anderhalfkopjekoffie.nl/drawfulfb.png">Drawful</a>.
<br>Why the weird spelling? Bart had to scrap some letters ‘cause of the character limit in Quiplash.
<br>Not much more than a week after that party, they finally made their relationship fbofical.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">KUTJORI</span></h5>
<p><!--This meme’s first occurance was at the Link BBQ just before the summer break in 2017.
<br>-->On the day of the General Assembly in 17/18, at precicely 19:00, Yosje’s idea, about ten Link members <a href="http://anderhalfkopjekoffie.nl/kutjori.jpg">collectively sent</a> ‘kutjori’ to Jori. Why? He wasn’t there WITH HIS FRIENDS at the time, but he was at home playing Rocket League. Kutjori.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">LEAVE 10 MINUTES EARLY</span></h5>
<p>A student of teacher Joost, aka Meme Machine™, one day asked him if she could leave class 10 minutes earlier - to catch a bus. She would have to wait half an hour if she couldn’t leave. Joost did not make her leave, even when the girl showed him she got permission from her mom. The situation was brought up by Joost in the Link Social chat, which fueled a great discussion.
<br>This meme now gets used when someone misses a bus or train, stating “Joost should have let you leave 10 minutes earlier”.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">LINK DOTA TEAM</span></h5>
<p>Link does not have and will never have enough Dota players to form a team.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">LINK GAME ROOM</span></h5>
<p>Every ‘official’ Link meeting, people would ask Link (especially Maurits) about an official ‘Link Game Room’. Maurits would always respond “yes yes working on it, it will happen in the future” - yet there is still no game room..
<br>On November 13th 2017, Maurits even publicly claimed: <i>"Game room is happening before I leave or I will chain myself to the table where the board of the Uni meets"</i>.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">MARTIJN ONE EYE</span></h5>
<p>There was a Pathfinder group consisting of (at the time of the meme’s birth) five Link members: Tom, Martijn, Stephen, Justin and Geerlof.
<br>In this campaign, Martijn’s character lost an eye (because of Geerlof). In the blink of an eye, a lot of eye-dadjokes emerged.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">NEVER ON TIME AT PATHÉ</span></h5>
<p>So, when the Link movie crew was ‘new’ and the Unlimited fiasco just happened, Joost took task of ordering tickets for everyone.
However, every single time, Joost would not be on time for the movie.
<br>He proudly broke this streak one day, when he was at Pathé one hour early; to make sure he would actually be there on time.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">PATHÉ UNLIMITED</span></h5>
<p>When the Link movie chat was born on the 24th of October, only four members (Muriel, Jori, Roos and Lucas) had a Pathé Unlimited subscription.
<br>Then, within a week’s time, I shit you not, twelve (!) Link members also got a subscription because of peer pressure. This brought the total number of Link members with a subscription to 16 people.
<br>The greatest part of this meme: Pathé raised the price of Unlimited on the 31th of October.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">pls no (Maurits)</span></h5>
<p>An official president distress call to stop discussions from going to edgy/offensive.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">SEXYTIME & HOERENTENT</span></h5>
<p>Link meme machine Joost has an apartment in Den Bosch, with lights that can be controlled using Siri.
<br>On of the things you can shout is ‘Sexytime’ which will turn most of his lights pink, to set the mood. An other command is ‘Hoerentent’ which will turn the lights red.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">STOLEN LINK JACKETS</span></h5>
<p>Link had some really cool jackets in 2017. Bart and (at the time) new Link member Michelle both just got these really cool new jackets. Just a few days after getting them, they went to Polly with some other members.
<br>Both of their jackets got stolen that night.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">WASABI CHALLENGE</span></h5>
<p>This meme finds it’s origin while a huge group of Link members came together to eat sushi in October of 2017.
<br>Joost & Geerlof decided to both take a sizeable chunk of wasabi, for the memes. Geerlof then first said the famous words: “Ik voel eigenlijk niet zo”. Meanwhile, Tobian could just eat whatever amount of Wasabi and not feel a thing.
<br>The comedic performance was filmed by Muriel and a <a href="http://anderhalfkopjekoffie.nl/wasabi.mp4">video</a> was then made by Joost featuring the ‘Curb your enthousiasm’ theme. This video actually turned out to be the first ever meme-video that Joost, unofficial meme machine, made for Link.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">WII TUNE (fuck Bart)</span></h5>
<p>tu. tu tu..tu. tu - tututu</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">WILDE ROOS & SJAAK AFHAAK</span></h5>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this meme is all about Roos aka Sjaak Afhaak.
<br>Wilde Roos found it’s origin in Jori posting an <a href="http://anderhalfkopjekoffie.nl/wilderoos.jpeg">image</a> of a bottle of shampoo with the text ‘Wilde Roos’ on it.
<br>Sjaak Afhaak is Roos’ middle name - props to Geerlof for finding out about it.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">ZOUTE YOGHURT (AYRAN)</span></h5>
<p>This meme finds it’s origin right after the time a huge group of Link members came together to eat sushi in October of 2017.
<br>After sushi, we all stood in front of the restaurant saying our goodbye’s. Notable Link members that were there: Muriel, Jeroen & Joost. Next to the sushi-place there was some kind of Turkish-food-thing. All of a sudden, Muriel mentioned ‘Ayran’. “Iran?” said Jeroen & Joost. Muriel continued explaining that it was something like ‘Zoute Yoghurt’.
<br>That’s it.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">18-INT</span></h5>
<p>There was a Pathfinder group consisting of (at the time of the meme’s birth) six Link members: Tom, Martijn, Stephen, Justin, Joost and most importantly: Geerlof. Who would have guessed.
<br>Geerlof’s character in the campaign had an int-score of 18 and bragged a lot about it. Despite of his 18-int, his character was arguably the least intelligent in decision making; maybe short of Martijn.</p>
<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">119.5 SECONDS & 232 DEGREES</span></h5>
<p>Joost went to Dublin with a friend in the summer of 2017, where he went to the Guinness Storehouse. There he encountered several ‘Fun Facts™’ that Joost all told at people present at Sam’s last day at Café Hoegaarden.
<br>The 119.5 seconds was one of Joost’s many fun facts. It takes exactly this much time to pour a perfect pint of Guinness.
<br>The 232 degrees was yet another of Joost’s many fun facts. It is the exact temperature (C) that the Barley, one of the ingredients in Guinness, is roasted to get it’s perfect color and texture.</p>
